# Exercise

Clone this repository to your computer via the CLI (cmd or terminal):
* Open the CLI
* Move to a folder where you want to clone the repo (it will automatically create a folder with the name of the repo):
  You probably need these commands:
  * cd *name_of_subfolder*
  * cd ..
  * git clone *url*
* Once cloned, you can open the folder in your IDE (e.g. Webstorm) and start working on the code
* Add your REAL name to the README.md file
* Commit your changes in the terminal (!) with the following commands:
  * git add .
  * git commit -m "Added my name"
  * git push origin main OR git push
  * git status (optional)
  * git pull
  * stefan

## Commands explained:
When you've made a handful of meaningful changes to the code, you can bundle them and label them (a **commit**):
* git add . 
  * adds all files in the current folder to the commit, including NEW ones
* git commit -m "A label text that describes what has been changed" 
  * create the commit with a label (message) into the local repository (on your computer)
* git push origin main     OR    git push
  * push the commit to the remote repository (GitHub)
* git status (optional)
  * shows the status of the local repository (on your computer)
* git pull 
  * pull the latest changes from the remote repository (GitHub) to your local repository
